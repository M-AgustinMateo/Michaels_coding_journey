# Michaels_coding_journey
A collection of projects I have worked on as an applied Physicist

Many of these projects have been completed out of my interest in the topic and a personal goal of becoming a better programmer.
Many topics here, and it is a continued work in progress as I find other projects/ideas that interest me!
